  - text: "In the artistâ€™s vision, the sight of a trapped plastic bottle evokes the
      image of a Sufi dance. This endlessly repeating dance becomes a metaphor
      for the cyclical nature of life itself, and at the same time a reminder of
      the eternal nature of plastic. Just as the Sufis spin in an incessant
      motion, so plastic, although being a human creation, seems destined to
      persist without end, trapped in our world. The author sees in this
      parallel a reference to human condition: an eternal repetition, a cycle
      that does not stop, where plastic becomes a symbol of what remains,
      persistent and indestructible."
