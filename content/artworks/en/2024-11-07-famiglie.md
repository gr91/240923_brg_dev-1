      …Family photographs are real bore.


      Looking through an album of photographs from years ago, we usually feel unhappy or horribly embarrassed about a tragically fashionable hairstyle or sweater. You see familiar faces, tables laden with cakes and candles, Christmas tree, graduation parties, wedding, christenings and holidays.

      Above all, they have given us the possibility of witnessing an inside view
      of that universal institution called the family; familiar to us and yet
      obscure, frequently talked about but rarely questioned, the best protector
      or disruptor in one’s development.

      ...Bruna Ginammi’s Italian family, in its dryness, looks very much like
      the one traced by the extensive surveys of research institutes: it is
      growing smaller and is sometimes lonelier.
