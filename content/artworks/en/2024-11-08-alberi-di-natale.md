      This series explores the importance of Christmas through its symbol, the
      decorated fir tree, a pagan tradition that later became a Christian
      representation of eternal life. This project focuses on emphasising the
      charm of anonymity.


      Christmas trees are photographed in Milan at night, in the entryways of apartment buildings.
