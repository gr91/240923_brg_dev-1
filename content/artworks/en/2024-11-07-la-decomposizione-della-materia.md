description:
  - text: >-
      …reality with its untiring pulsing of life and forms is incarnated-
      without our knowing it-in every fraction of a second of daily life, with
      neither hierarchies not right of precedence: it will be the intentionality
      of the artistic gesture that evidences meaning and shows that nothing of
      existence is to be discarded.

      …These photograhs of plants deteriorating from the combined effects of
      time and the environment are portraits.


      …These photographs are landscape.


      Utopian and fabulous landscapes. Lysergic.


      …you look at these photographs with bated breath.


      You see a nature that is at once fascinating and frightening.
