      This work is dedicated to all migrants who have hoped for a better life by
      crossing the sea in precarious conditions, finding the end of their
      existence in its waters.


      The images show the chambers of rest and the flowers that decorated the coffins.


      When we attend a funeral to say goodbye to our loved ones we usually hold a flower in our hands as a reminder, a symbol of life.
