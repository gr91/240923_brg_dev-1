      After making *Poetry Saves the World* using Braille characters, this work
      investigates the alphabet of the blind. The photographerâ€™s gaze lingers on
      medicinal packagings bearing these graphic signs.


      Being unable to read Braille, these alphabet characters, these mysterious dots, appear as enigmatic constellations. This composition intends to highlight the physical nature of words.
