      This is a series dedicated to the poor, to all those living on the streets
      because they have no home.


      Many spend time in the parks of Milan, leaving behind, as a trace of their passage, items of clothing that over time become one with the ground.


      These fabrics, these remnants, are human traces that integrate with the grass and mud, looking like colourful flowers sprouting from the ground.
