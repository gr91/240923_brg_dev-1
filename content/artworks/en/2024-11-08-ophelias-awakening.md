  - text: This interpretation of the figure of Ophelia represents a very interesting
      and positive reading of the character. Traditionally in the tragedy of
      *Hamlet* Ophelia dies. Here the young Ophelia sleeps, in a white limbo she
      recovers her energy and bursts into a big smile. The triumph of life over
      death is a powerful theme, which sheds new light on a character who in
      Shakespeareâ€™s tragedy represents grief and loss. Here, Ophelia becomes a
      symbol of hope and rebirth, an interpretation that reverses her sorrowful
      end.
