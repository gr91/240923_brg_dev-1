      Kosmos is a work stemming from an interaction of plastic, water, and
      light.


      What emerges is poised between myth and mystery of known places and forms. The truth is that a world made of plastic is inaccessible to any form of life.

      For this latest photographic research, one has to go back to the medieval
      Bestiaries, rich volumes describing countless bizarre creatures, in a
      combination of real and fantastic animals.


      These photographs therefore offer a possible reading addressing countless “environmental issues” to remind us of the Apocalypse, our ongoing self-destruction.
