      Through animated mythological figures, this narrative describes how human
      life came about on earth. 


      Seen with a 180° rotation these photographs of trees in the parks of Milan, take on human and divine semblances.


      In different shades and tones of red, the colour symbol of blood and Eros, the backgrounds enrich each mythological figure with pathos.

      This time, as a painter would do, Bruna Ginammi entrusts to
      colour-that-becomes-space the task of removing the superfluous, of
      guaranteeing a formal balance and operating an almost Zen-like and
      minimalist synthesis...
