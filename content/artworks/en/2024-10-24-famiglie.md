  …Family photographs are real bore.


  Looking through an album of photographs from years ago, we usually feel unhappy or horribly embarrassed about a tragically fashionable hairstyle or sweater. You see familiar faces, tables laden with cakes and candles, Christmas tree, graduation parties, wedding, christenings and holidays.


  Barbara Casavecchia


  Traduzione Maria Maghini






  Above all, they have given us the possibility of witnessing an inside view of that universal institution called the family; familiar to us and yet obscure, frequently talked about but rarely questioned, the best protector or disruptor in one’s development. 


  Da Tilde Giani Gallino,
