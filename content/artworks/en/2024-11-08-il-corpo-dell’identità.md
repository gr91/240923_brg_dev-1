      I started taking photos of myself in 1994 to get to know myself in greater
      depth, to investigate the multiple identifications that inhabit me and to
      delve into the multifaceted aspects of femininity. 


      Self-portraits are a complex and enriching operation, they allow me to immerse myself completely in the scene I want to represent; in the split second of a shot I find myself being director, actress, and spectator, allowing me to broaden the horizons of my understanding.


      In the third millennium, I intend to continue to be an active participant as a photographer because as Donata Pizzi says, “photography of women is feminist because the personal is political”.
