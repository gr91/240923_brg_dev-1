      I started taking photos of myself in 1994 to get to know myself in greater
      depth, to investigate the multiple identifications that inhabit me and to
      delve into the multifaceted aspects of femininity. 


      Self-portraits are a complex and enriching operation, they allow me to immerse myself completely in the scene I want to represent; in the split second of a shot I find myself being director, actress, and spectator, allowing me to broaden the horizons of my understanding.


      In the third millennium, I intend to continue to be an active participant as a photographer because as Donata Pizzi says, “photography of women is feminist because the personal is political”.

      Text by Bruna Ginammi 


      Extract from Cristina Casero, ed. *Fotografia e femminismo nell’Italia degli anni Settanta: Rispecchiamento, indagine critica e testimonianza* (Milan: postmedia books, 2021), 156–157, ISBN-9788874903023

      The nudes she dedicates to herself are so devoid of predictability as to
      appear almost clad in the candour of human observation.


      To me this kind of photography escapes all the clichés of rhetorical or erotic nudes, attaining a neo-simplicity. At a time of touristic nudes, Bruna Ginammi knows how to find a representation so bare that it attains a language of its own.
