      This work is a homage to romantic films. 


      The dialogues are taken from various movies; 


      the protagonists are two lovers who promise each other eternal love, but due to a series of events they are forced to separate, breaking their promise.


      Their conversations are written on the wall of a double single-bed room. The meaning of the dialogues can be inferred by reading the shape of the unmade beds, where sheets, blankets and towels form an alphabet.
