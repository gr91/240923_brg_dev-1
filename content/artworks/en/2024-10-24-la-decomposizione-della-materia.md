  …reality with its untiring pulsing of life and forms is incarnated- without
  our knowing it-in every fraction of a second of daily life, with neither
  hierarchies not right of precedence: it will be the intentionality of the
  artistic gesture that evidences meaning and shows that nothing of existence is
  to be discarded.

  …These photograhs of plants deteriorating from the combined effects of time and the environment are portraits.


  …These photographs are landscape. Utopian and fabulous landscapes. Lysergic.


  …you look at these photographs with bated breath.You see a nature that is at once fascinating and frightening.
