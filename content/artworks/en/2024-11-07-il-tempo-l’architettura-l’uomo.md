      The destruction of PAC appeared unbearable to many and its reconstruction
      necessary. For Bruna Ginammi it was only natural, very important, and
      logical to document it. From the outset, therefore, she worked in such a
      way as to simultaneously analyse the progress of the work and the men at
      work, their gestures, their faces.


      In a first set of photographs, she explores the situation immediately after the destruction, the clearing of the rubble, and the commemorative events. 


      In a second set, Bruna Ginammi carries out an actual analysis of the progress of the reconstruction work by identifying three main view points from which she takes identical shots over time, later adding a few other angles made necessary by the progress of the work. The third and final set covers all the types of work being carried out by the workers, to whom she also dedicates individual portraits, all the spaces captured from different angles, plus a number of details, objects, fragments through which traces of the past come to the surface.
