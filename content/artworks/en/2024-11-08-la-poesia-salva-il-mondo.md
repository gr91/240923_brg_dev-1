      This work speaks of poetry as a creative force in which sounds are also
      important, accompanied by voices that in all the languages of the world
      utter “poetry saves the world”. The words are written using the Braille
      alphabet to express the concept of difference, in fact poetry is expressed
      in verse, unlike prose which does not need this tool.


      Poetry saves the world is an installation consisting of a stack of white paper sheets (21.1x29.27cm) with an embossed Braille alphabet inscription (Poetry Saves the World) positioned on a pedestal and an audio recording playing in the room.


      Viewers are free to take the sheets of paper.
