description:
  - text: The author photographs various parts of her body, creating a visual jigsaw
      puzzle pieced together through video fragments and photographs. These
      fragments represent significant moments in her life and history, combining
      her personal and collective experience. The images depict characters and
      events that have marked the course of history with a capital ‘S’ \[Storia,
      History], from 1964, the year of the artist’s birth, to the present day.
      In the video, the visual collage becomes a reflection on time, identity
      and how individual experiences are intertwined with major historical
      narratives.
