  - text: The video suggests a profound reflection on the relationship between human
      beings and nature. Inspired by the myth of Kronos, who devours his own
      children for fear of losing his throne, the video overturns this image,
      showing how today it is human beings who ‘are devouring’ ‘Mother Earth’.
      Through devastating actions such as deforestation, industrial agriculture,
      climate change, heavy use of plant protection products and intensive
      farming, humans are threatening the health of the planet and their own.
      The artist, dressed in the sound of the wind ‘eating’ the earth, expresses
      her indignation at this reality and urges reflection on the impact of
      human actions on the environment. Furthermore, the video evokes a sacred
      and spiritual aspect with the phrase ‘when you eat a potato you eat your
      ancestors’ (*Essere Natura*, Andrea Staid) referring to the profound
      connection between humans and the Earth. Every action that human beings
      take involving the environment has repercussions not only on nature, but
      also on themselves.
