      This work is about a love correspondence carried out on WhatsApp, a social
      media platform where, due to updates, messages can evaporate and data
      often may get lost or deleted.


      In the age of social media, everything seems ephemeral; to preserve and cherish the memory of the epistolary exchange, this correspondence has been printed on linen with the slow technique of hand embroidery, giving weight and value to the connection.
