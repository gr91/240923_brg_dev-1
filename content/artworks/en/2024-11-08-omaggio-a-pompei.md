      We are living in the age of microplastics that can be found in the water
      we drink and the food we eat.


      Microplastics will survive time and plastic casts of our bodies will remain, as in the eruption of Vesuvius in 79 BCE that took the inhabitants of Pompeii by surprise.


      Several years later, the bodies of entire sleeping families were found covered by a thick layer of pumice and ash.


      Just as the casts of the inhabitants of Pompeii were found thousands of years later, someday plastic casts of our bodies will also be found.
