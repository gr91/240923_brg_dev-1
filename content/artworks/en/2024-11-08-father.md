      This video speaks of the search for truth, without illusions or pretence,
      as a path that highlights the human inability to grasp the totality of the
      mysteries of existence. In this sense, the reference to Saint Augustine is
      significant: just as the philosopher and theologian had to recognise the
      limits of the human mind in understanding God and his mysteries, so too
      the author, in her symbolic gesture, is confronted with the paradox of the
      impossibility of fully understanding reality. The sea, with its vastness
      and depth, becomes a metaphor for the mysteries of life, while the hole in
      the sand symbolises the human desire to make sense of what eludes
      comprehension.


      The video, therefore, becomes a reflection on the nature of knowledge, humility in the face of the unknown and the ongoing search for truth.
