      …They voyage- like container ship, container caravels: each viso is a
      sailing vaso, a receptacle: to carry Curiosity and Misery, some music of
      the Measureless, some measure of the Fathomless, some dogged stares ( by
      baffled and unbaffled lens) at the Inscrutable.

      Looking also means guarding: Bruna Ginammi’s eye guards the gazes of
      poets.
