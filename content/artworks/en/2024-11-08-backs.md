      This work is inspired by the observation of Man Ray’s photograph *Le
      Violon d’Ingres*.


      It is a self-portrait in which we see a back used as if it were a blackboard with inscriptions addressing issues such as identity, social and political matters, and climate change.


      Emoji and words expressing emotions and thoughts are pasted on the body using the collage technique.
